I implement an LSC editor along with the necessary algorithms for realizability checking of scenarios in GROOVE(Graph Transformation Tool http://groove.cs.utwente.nl/about/).
To demonstrate how the approach works, we specify system properties of different known case studies by scenario and then specify the realizability of them.
